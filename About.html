        <h2>AKAN NAMES</h2>
        <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. 
            These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety 
            and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and 
            the African diaspora. During the 18th–19th centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred 
            to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or
             Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.
            </p>
            <p>Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name. Notable figures with day names
                 include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
In the official orthography of the Twi language, the Ashanti versions of these names as spoken in Kumasi are as follows. The diacritics on á a̍ à represent 
high, mid, and low tone (tone does not need to be marked on every vowel), while the diacritic on a̩ is used for vowel harmony and can be ignored.
(Diacritics are frequently dropped in any case.) Variants of the names are used in other languages, or may represent different transliteration schemes. 
The variants mostly consist of different affixes (in Ashanti, kwa- or ko- for men and a- plus -a or -wa for women). For example, among the Fante, the 
prefixes are kwe-, kwa or ko for men and e-, arespectively. Akan d̩wo or jo(Fante) is pronounced something like English Joe, but there do appear to be two 
sets of names for those born on Monday.</p>

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Twin_names">TWIN NAMES</span></h2>
    <p>
        There are also special names for elder and younger twins. The second twin to be born is considered the elder as they were mature enough to help their sibling out first. (The definition above must be a regional concept because in Cape Coast, heart of Fanti land, the elder twin is the one who comes out first, the second twin is considered the younger one. Therefore, 
        The younger twin would be Kakra; the older twin would be Panyin.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The word Panyin means older/elder. Kakra is short for Kakraba which means little/younger one. The definition/description below 
        for the meaning of younger and an elder are backwards or vice versa.
