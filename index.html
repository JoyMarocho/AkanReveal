            <p>This page reveals your expected birthname in the Ghana.
                It takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending
                on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in
                Ghana,
                children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were
                born.
            </p>

            <h2> THE People of Akan </h2>
        <p>
            The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the
            order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
            the person.
            Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
            ancestor's middle name. This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora.
            During the 18thâ€“19th centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana
            were referred to as Coromantees.
            Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe
            or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.
